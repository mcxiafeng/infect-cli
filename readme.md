After it has been installed, you can use `infect --help`.<br>


## Warning
#### Plugin issues
- Some plugins simply do not build within the CLI, if you think it's taking a bit long, try to execute the build command it logs in the directory provided to you, this may show useful information in order to fix your issue. Other times, it could just not easily work with Infect, causing you to have to infect that said plugin manually.
